                    Jagadguru Sri Veerasimhasana Math, a religious monastery
                    situated at Suttur in Mysore District of Karnataka State,
                    has a history of about one thousand years. Jagadguru Sri
                    Shivarathrishwara Mahavidyapeetha, popularly known as JSS
                    Mahavidyapeetha (JSSMVP), sponsored by the above Math, was
                    established during 1954 by the then President of JSSMVP, His
                    Holiness Jagadguru Dr Sri Shivarathri Rajendra Mahaswamiji.
                    The vision of His Holiness has triggered an education
                    revolution, particularly in the backward rural areas of
                    Mysore District during the last four decades. His vision was
                    responsible for bringing about an excellent blend of the
                    traditional culture with modern science, leading to total
                    personality development of individuals through a network of
                    over two hundred and seventy five education institutions,
                    propagating both cultural education and modern
                    multi-disciplinary professional education. The present
                    Pontiff, His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Sri Shivarathri
                    Deshikendra Mahaswamiji, is heading the JSS Mahavidyapeetha
                    as its President.

                  <p>
                    Today, JSSMVP under the spiritual guidance of His Holiness,
                    is on the threshold of launching many more programmes
                    covering all aspects of life in the service of the nation.
                    His Holinessâ€™s vision, enthusiasm, spirit of dedication is
                    incomparable. The long tradition of the JSS Mahavidyapeetha
                    is being continued now with renewed force and fervor.
