                  <p>
                    The National Service Scheme (NSS) is an Indian
                    government-sponsored public service program conducted by the
                    Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Government of
                    India. Popularly known as NSS, the scheme was launched in
                    Gandhiji&#8217;s Centenary year, 1969. Aimed at developing
                    student&#8217;s personality through community service, NSS
                    is a voluntary association of young people in Colleges,
                    Universities and at +2 level working for a campus-community
                    linkage.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After independence the University Grants Commission, headed
                    by S. Radhakrishnan, recommended the introduction of
                    voluntary national service in academic institutions. This
                    idea was again considered by the Central Advisory Board of
                    Education (CABE) at its meeting in January, 1950; after
                    examining the idea and the experiences of other countries in
                    this field, the board recommended that students and teachers
                    should devote time to voluntary manual work.
