                    The Aims of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of
                    time and continue to meet the requirements expected of it in
                    the current socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC
                    aims at developing character, comradeship, discipline, a
                    secular outlook, the spirit of adventure and ideals of
                    selfless service amongst young citizens. Further, it aims at
                    creating a pool of organized, trained and motivated youth
                    with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who will
                    serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose.
                    Needless to say, the NCC also provides an environment
                    conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed
                    forces.
